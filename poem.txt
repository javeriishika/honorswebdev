Title: A Simple Poem

In the garden of silence,
Where flowers bloom without violence.
A whispering breeze,
Sways through the trees.

Nature's melody, soft and sweet,
A symphony of life's heartbeat.
Stars above in the night sky,
Tell tales of a lullaby.

Moonlight paints a silver trail,
On a quiet, serene dale.
As the world dreams in peace,
Night's embrace will never cease.
